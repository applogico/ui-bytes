# useActionState hook

Are you ready to hit the ground running when React 19 is officially released?

There’s a ton of exciting new features coming in the next major React release.

One of the standout additions is the new useActionState hook, which simplifies how we handle errors and pending states in React actions. You can now use it instead of useTransition to streamline form actions.

```jsx
function UpdateProfile({ profile }) {
  const [error, submit, isPending] =
    useActionState(
      async (prevState, data) => {
        const err = await apiCall(data)
        if (err) {
          return err
        }
        redirect('/success')
        return null
      },
      null, // Initial state (error)
    )

  return (
    <form action={submit}>
      <input type="text" name="name" />
      <input type="text" name="email" />

      <button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>
        Update
      </button>

      {error && <p>{error}</p>}
    </form>
  )
}
```

In this example, useActionState takes an async action function that handles form submission. It updates the error state by returning a non-null value when necessary.

The function body is also a perfect place to handle state updates or side effects when the action completes successfully—like redirecting the user to a success page, as shown here.

Notice how the form and its children are cleanly rendered. Thanks to useActionState, we no longer need to create or maintain additional state values.

This simple yet powerful hook makes managing component state dependent on async actions even easier.
